 Always use the context7 MCP to search for documentation, and the GitHub MCP for GitHub-related tasks.
 In GitHub, for a hotfix always create a new branch or pick up the one you used for development, and send a PR when youâ€™re fixing a branch that has already been merged. NEVER USE MAIN FOR HOTFIXES OR FEATURES.
 Never merge your own PR without asking for a review.
