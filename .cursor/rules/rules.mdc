 In GitHub, for a hotfix always create a new branch or pick up the one you used for development, and send a PR when youâ€™re fixing a branch that has already been merged. NEVER USE MAIN FOR HOTFIXES OR FEATURES.
 Always use english for the code, comments, documentation and GitHub.
 Never merge your own PR without asking for a review.
 Never expose private keys in commits.
 Always use the context7 MCP to search for documentation, and the GitHub MCP for GitHub-related tasks.
